name: UART profile installation authority
description: Pin UART software compatibility to the installed BIT, not today's mutable hardware checkout.
---

For a UART-only developer workflow, preserve the exact installed FPGA profile
while allowing separately approved native software images to change. Do not
rebuild hardware or reject its operator installation evidence solely because
the workspace's hardware source tree has advanced.

**Why:** The user wants a second developer to use the IDE without JTAG. The
tested Amoeba retry BIT and the generic IDE upload projection implement different
memory layouts; a generic build-number claim cannot establish compatibility.
Mutable checkout hashes also cannot identify a previously installed BIT.

**How to apply:** Pin the explicit native profile to its exact BIT identity,
retain approved image bytes without legacy projection, and bind installation
evidence to the selected physical board/session. Offline format checking,
physical runtime replacement, and persistent flash programming remain distinct.
Do not treat transfer ACK as board readback or startup acceptance.
